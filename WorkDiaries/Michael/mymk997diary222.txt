Today I met with my group members for first time to discuss our plans for the project. I know the programming capabilities of two of my other members, but I am unsure of the capability of another member as he said he is not good in programming and has failed two programming subjects last semester. We delegated roles where I became the main programmer for the group. we agreed on using Java as our programming language since all four of us have completed a subject pertraining to Java last semester. However most of the programming will be done by me and secondary programmer Jason. For our version management system, we chose GitHub because of a recommendation from a friend who has used it in the past. It has good features that allow the programmers in a group to be able to branch of a main code repository, allow another member to check and test new code, and allow merging with existing code without creating conflicts or outdated versions. Tasks for this week include formulating questions to ask the client to elicit requirements for the Flight Management System and getting familiar with GitHub.

On Wednesday we discussed the requirements with the client. My tasks for this week include looking at a couple of existing airline booking systems to understand how they work and how some features can be copied into our own project. Also another task is the reviewing of the Use-Case Diagrams done by Steven and creating more use-case scenarios to present to the client in order to elicit more detailed requirements.

Weekly meeting. We identified the potential users of the system that will be directly involved in handling the system. Once we identified the users, we discussed the possible scenarios that each user might go through as he uses the system. We have completed that and we will ask the client more about the system through these user scenarios. Tasks for this week include getting further requirements from the client, drawing the use case diagrams and drawing the class diagrams. Once we have these diagrams, we can commence coding.

We elicited a few more requirements from the client. This week, we will work on the Use-Case diagrams, class diagrams and the SRS.

Weekly meeting. We discussed a few more requirements among ourselves and resolved some pending issues. Tomorrow and the day after we will show the client the completed use case diagram and class diagram to confirm whether we have the correct idea of the system or not.

Meeting during the study break. So the upcoming work to complete includes finishing the requirements part of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the risk and counter measures document, use case diagrams and descriptions, and the class diagram (domain model). This week I worked a couple of hours a day. So far, the bulk of the SRS is completed, just the requirements part is unfinished. The use case diagram is about ready while the domain model still needs some major work. Some possible defect include the possibility of an inaccurate use case diagram and domain model. I am confident the SRS is in good shape and will just need proofreading and some minor tweaks.

Work to do includes redesigning the domain model so that the program will function as per the SRS. Work also includes minor programming. Estimated time in total to finish tasks is about 24 hours and should finish by Saturday, late afternoon.
